 * It'll be complicated to create objects around without having a context available, but I'm not fond
   of creating static variables, for sake of testability and reentrance. We may should store the
   context in classes.
 * We could remove UlgObject, pass void* instead, would be less verbose when casting.
 * Add an error hooking mecanism, test for errors too in unit tests.
 * Support code coverage.
 * Setup CI on github.
 * Think (a lot) about virtual methods pertinence here.
