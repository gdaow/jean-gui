 * It'll be complicated to create objects around without having a context available, but I'm not fond
   of creating static variables, for sake of testability and reentrance. We may should store the
   context in classes.
 * Support code coverage.
 * Setup CI on github.
 * Add a magic number and an assert to raise early on UlgObjects pointer errors in debug.
 * Expose UlgProperty publicly : Maybe not. Actually, it may be a good idea to not even Expose
 * jg_object_get and jg_object_set publicly : all data modification may be done 'the native way',
   and data binding updates trigerred by calling event handlers. Only the binding system could access
   property getter / setters.
 * Handle OOM
 * Move jg_pool to another file than context.h
 * Use standard method (initialize / cleanup) for constructors / destructors.
 * Allow to switch between allocators to allow valgrind checks & benchmarks.
 * Use a struct for class ids to ease declaration.
 * Test jg_arguments, could be renamed to jg_call_context actually, and we could provide
   methods to call error on it. Maybe push the function result in it too.
 * Rename jg_module_add_class to jg_add_class, jg_class_add_method to jg_add_method.
